Home to the Motivate Me app!

Motivate Me is a lifestyle app that enables users to grow holistically. 

It is built on a two-fold approach. First, it assimilates the user’s social apps into one platform so that they can see all of their commitments in one place. Currently, the app integrates Facebook events and Google calendar. Second, it personifies the user’s state of well-being through a virtual pet, known as a Yavishti. The Yavishti’s provide unconditional love and support to the user throughout their journey. If the users take care of themselves, their Yavishtis will flourish. They are also rewarded by badges as they achieve milestones. This direct reflection of a user’s state of well-being should impel them to prioritize better and grow into a wholehearted individual.
